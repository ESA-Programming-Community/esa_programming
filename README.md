## Introduction

This repository is designed for our weekly web development learning sessions. Our goal is to cover fundamental concepts, practical coding exercises, and collaborative projects to enhance our skills in web development.

## Meeting Schedule

We meet once a week for a 2-hour learning session (3pm -5pm). The schedule may include lectures, coding exercises, and project work. Check the [Projects](projects/) tab to find details about ongoing and upcoming projects.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ESA-Programming-Community/esa_programming.git && cd esa_programming
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project:**

   - Change into the project directory for the specific project you're working on. For example, for Project 1:
     ```bash
     cd project1
     ```

3. **Create a Branch:**

   - Create a new branch for your work (your-branch-name can be your username with name of the project eg: destinydinam-project1):
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-branch-name
     ```

4. **Start Coding:**

   - Work on the exercises or projects assigned during the learning sessions.

5. **Commit Your Changes:**

   - Commit your changes to your branch:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Your commit message here"
     ```

     ```bash
     git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-name
     ```

7. **Review of Your Work:**
   - Your submitted work will undergo review.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized by project names. For example:

- **Project 1:**

  - Contains necessary files, resources, and guidelines specific to Project 1.
  - Directories and files structured according to the project's requirements.

- **Project 2:**
  - Similar structure as Project 1 but specific to Project 2.

Repeat this pattern for each subsequent project.
